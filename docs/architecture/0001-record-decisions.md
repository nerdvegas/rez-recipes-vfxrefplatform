# Record architecture decisions

* Status: Proposed
* Date: 2021-03-21

## Context and Problem Statement

It is likely that disagreements about the purpose and mechanics of this repository will come to light. For example, whether or not to provide offline source retrieval options, or which operating systems to support, or whether the primary purpose is to serve as a simple reference or complex one, build the minimal subset of the VFX Reference Platform, or a plethora of additional useful tools, etc. Therefore, architecture decision records can be used as a means to record what decisions have been made about the repository, its purpose, its plans, and so forth.

## Decision

Not yet decided.

## Positive Consequences

Decisions about the direction of work must be weighed prior to implementation, avoiding the possibility of developers doing unneeded or unmergeable work.

## Negative Consequences

Additional overhead in repository to maintain.
