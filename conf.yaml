# List of names of packages to build, in build order.
# We may choose to build non-vfx-platform-specific packages of sufficient utility,
# but whose specific version is not necessarily tracked or managed by the VRP,
# and as such, should only be considered version controlled as VRP projects require.
# (For example, we will rely on cmake - The VRP does not require cmake, but we will,
# even though you could absolutely rely on a system-level rez-bind'd cmake version.
#
packages:
  - platform
  - arch
  - os
  - cmake
  - python
  # TODO

# Arbitrary environment variables to influence build and/or package defns
